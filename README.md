This is a simple Drupal install for a presentation I gave at DrupalCorn 2016 on Vue.js and Drupal 8. It uses the [Lightning](https://www.drupal.org/project/lightning) distribution to give the site a basic, pre-configured starting point but none of the Vue.js bits depend on it.

## Installation
You will need the following installed:

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Getting Started

* git clone XXX
* cd vue-drupal
* composer install
* cd docroot/themes/custom/vue
* gulp

You'll also need to create a database, set up your web server, and go through the standard Drupal install.
